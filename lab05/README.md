# Microcontroller Systems and Interfacing

## Week 5 experimental lab

### 1 Connecting external LEDs

The light-emitting diode (LED) connected to digital pin 13 is useful for debugging, but we can make more versatile LED
displays. Let’s connect a couple of LEDs to digital outputs and investigate some interesting behaviour.

#### 1.1 Circuit for each LED

Use Ohm’s law to calculate the resistor value that allows 10 mA to flow when the voltage across it is 3 V.

#### 1.2 Breadboard layout for one external LED

Connect one LED as shown on the right. Create a simple program to blink the LED once per second,
just to verify that the circuit is working.

#### 1.3 Using multiple LEDs

Add a second LED to the system. Make the LEDs blink at opposite times. Control the blinking speed using an external
analogue voltage. Experiment with different delays.

#### 1.4 Using shorter cycle times.

Increase the resolution of the delay so that it can be very short.
